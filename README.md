# PC Photos

[Bản Tiếng Việt](./README-vi.md)

A self-hosted, private cloud web application for backing up, organizing, and viewing photos and videos with a smooth interface and experience inspired by Apple Photos.

The system is designed to run optimally on home servers or NAS devices integrated with external hard drives (HDD) and is securely routed via Cloudflare Tunnel.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Apple Photos-like Media Experience
*   **Smooth gallery grid**: High-performance grid display with virtual scrolling and a beautiful lightbox media viewer.
*   **Vertical media support**: Smart layout fit and background blur (blur effect) to seamlessly display vertical photos and videos.
*   **Multi-selection mode**: Support for long-press and multi-item actions for bulk operations.

### 2. Albums & Document Projects
*   **Albums**: Manually group photos/videos. A single media asset can belong to multiple albums.
*   **Document Projects**: A dedicated sidebar for documents (PDF, Docs) with project grouping and file type filtering.
*   **Trash management**: Supports soft delete, restore, and permanent purge actions.

### 3. High-Performance Media Pipeline
*   **Chunk uploads**: Large files (>90MB) are automatically uploaded in chunks to prevent network timeout issues.
*   **Image optimization**: Automatic compression and generation of lightweight variants (`thumb.webp`, `preview.avif`).
*   **Video streaming**: Dynamic video streaming via Range Requests or standard HLS VOD for buffer-free playback on all devices and reduced bandwidth.

### 4. Disk Space Dashboard
*   **Visual breakdown**: Displays total, used, and free disk space, showing exact usage for originals, derived files, and trash.
*   **Usage update freeze**: Temporarily freezes dashboard usage updates while transcoding jobs are running to avoid UI flickering.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application is fully containerized using Docker and comprises the following services:

*   **`hcphotos-fe`**: Next.js frontend (App Router) running on port `45173`.
*   **`hcphotos-be`**: RESTful API Backend built with Node.js / Express running on port `45174`.
*   **`hcphotos-worker`**: Worker processing background tasks (EXIF extraction, thumbnail generation via Sharp, video transcoding via FFmpeg).
*   **`hcphotos-db`**: PostgreSQL database for metadata storage.
*   **`hcphotos-redis`**: Redis instance managing the background job queues.
*   **`cloudflared`**: Connects and routes your local services directly to the internet securely via Cloudflare Tunnel (no Nginx required).

## 🛠️ Getting Started (Local Development)

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables
Copy the template configuration file and configure the required parameters (especially administrator credentials, JWT secrets, and the HDD mount path):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the configurations inside the .env file to match your local setup
```

### 2. Run the Application
Launch all services in detached mode using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### 3. Verifying Endpoints
*   **Frontend**: `http://localhost:45173` (Automatically redirects to `/login` or `/dashboard`).
*   **Backend Health Check**: `http://localhost:45174/api/health`
*   **Storage Usage API**: `http://localhost:45174/api/storage/usage` (Requires authentication).

## 🌐 Production Deployment & Cloudflare Tunnel
When deploying for production under your own domain name:
1.  Configure the tunnel config in `infra/cloudflared/config.yml` (refer to the sample at `infra/cloudflared/config.example.yml`).
2.  Route your Frontend domain and API Backend domain to their respective docker containers.
